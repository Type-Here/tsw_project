# University Project E-Commerce

## Exam Requirements
1. The site must be responsive.
2. The site must run directly on Tomcat and not in the development environment. Note: the environment (IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.) should not be running, meaning it must be closed. Tomcat must be configured to use HTTPS.
3. The MVC model must be used.
4. At least two packages must be created: one for the Controller and one for the Model.
5. The Model must contain the beans, the cart, and the application logic.
6. HTML code must be created exclusively by JSP and HTML that form the view.
7. Use a relational database for data storage.
8. Forms must be validated both client-side (with JavaScript and/or HTML) and server-side (in the servlet). This means that the servlet must repeat the validations already performed in the HTML page. The form is sent to the server only if it is correct.
9. Use JavaScript to modify the DOM on some pages.
10. Use AJAX to exchange data with the server in JSON format on some pages of the site (not all).
11. Manage sessions to implement the cart or similar structures.
12. Different functionalities must be provided for each of the following roles: administrator, registered user, and non-registered user. The non-authenticated user must be able to use the cart.
13. Pay attention to the quality of the interface, the interaction with the application, and the notifications as much as possible.
14. The site's CSS must be written manually (without using CSS libraries or frameworks such as Bootstrap).
15. The site's database must contain numerous products, users, completed orders, etc.
16. Pay attention to the consistency of the database (e.g., what happens to an already completed order if a product is deleted or its price is changed).
17. Encrypt the passwords in the database.
18. Use expression language in JSP.
19. Do NOT use JQuery.
20. If cookies are used, they must be only on HTTPS.
21. Verify the site's accessibility using Firefox Web Developer Tools (Accessibility tab, "Identify issues for"; try to meet at least "keyboard" and "text labels" in your site).


## Our Project Idea: RetroGamer

Our site, named "RetroGamer," is a digital store specializing in the sale of classic and retro video games, with the option to also obtain physical copies of games for consoles such as NES, PS1, Sega Genesis, and other historic platforms.  
RetroGamer caters to video game enthusiasts of all ages, particularly those who have a strong nostalgia for games from past decades and who wish to relive the experience of playing titles that have marked the history of video games.
